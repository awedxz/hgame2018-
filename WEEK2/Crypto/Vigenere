MANY YEARS LATER as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that
distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice. At that time Macondo was a village of
twenty adobe houses, built on the bank of a river of clear water that ran along a bed of polished
stones, which were white and enormous, like prehistoric eggs. The world was so recent that many
things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point. Every year during the
month of March a family of ragged gypsies would set up their tents near the village, and with a great
uproar of pipes and kettledrums they would display new inventions. First they brought the magnet.
A heavy gypsy with an untamed beard and sparrow hands, who introduced himself as Melquíades,
put on a bold public demonstration of what he himself called the eighth wonder of the learned alchemists
of Macedonia.
